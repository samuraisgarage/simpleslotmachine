First GitHub upload; learning how to use this platform.
I created this Python program with the help of Tech with Tim's YouTube video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4OBktqK1I

I am trying to get back into coding as a hobby and the purpose of me making this program was to refresh myself in the ability to read and understand syntax.
I chose this one specifially because while it remains simple, it is a more complicated program than something as long the lines of Hello World.

I will probably do a couple more Python projects and move onto Javascript or GoLang.
